My own zsh setup and prompt.
Full auto-completion, syntax-highlighting, history, auto-completion, and integration with fzf and zoxide.
The left and right prompts are clean and minimal while providing full and clear information.

The prompt looks like this where a git repository is present and the previous command was successful...
✔ .config/zsh                         20:42:13 ~/.config/zsh [* master] <mike>

and when a command fails, it looks like this...
ls: cannot access 'zzz': No such file or directory
(2✗) ~                                                    20:44:36 ~ [] <mike>
